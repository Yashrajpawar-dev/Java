A repo for uploading my java journey
Welcome to my Java learning journey! This is a personal log of how I'm growing as a Java developer—one line of code at a time. I've always been fascinated by how powerful and versatile Java is, and this journey is all about exploring that potential through consistent practice, real-world projects, and continuous learning.

I began this journey with a clear set of goals in mind. First and foremost, I wanted to understand the fundamentals of Java, including syntax, variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. Once I got comfortable with the basics, I dove into the core of Java—object-oriented programming. Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism have helped me appreciate the structured approach Java promotes.

Along the way, I’ve been using several resources to guide my learning. Books like Head First Java, video tutorials on YouTube, and interactive platforms such as Codecademy, LeetCode, and HackerRank have played a major role in building my foundation. I’ve also been exploring the official Java documentation from Oracle to gain in-depth understanding of various libraries and features.

To make my learning practical, I’ve been working on small projects such as a command-line calculator and a student management system. These projects allow me to apply what I’ve learned and understand real-world scenarios better. I plan to move on to more advanced applications like building REST APIs with Spring Boot, integrating databases using JDBC, and even creating GUI applications and simple games.

My development setup includes tools like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA for writing and debugging code. I’m also getting familiar with build tools like Maven and version control using Git and GitHub. I’ve chosen Java 17 LTS as my main version for development.

This journey isn’t just about learning syntax—it’s about developing problem-solving skills, writing clean code, understanding architecture, and building something meaningful. Every time I solve a bug or understand a new concept, I feel one step closer to becoming a confident Java developer.

Whether it's learning exception handling, mastering collections, or diving into multithreading and file handling, I’m excited for every chapter ahead. I plan to document not just my progress, but also the lessons learned and challenges faced. This isn’t just a project—it's a path to becoming the kind of developer who builds real impact.

Thanks for following along—and if you're on your own Java journey, let’s connect and grow together!
